# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release. 
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements** 
and **Merged pull requests**. Critical items to know are:

 - renamed commands
 - deprecated / removed commands
 - changed defaults or behavior
 - backward incompatible changes

Referenced versions in headers are tagged on Github, in parentheses are for pypi.

## [vxx](https://github.com/urlstechie/urlschecker-python/tree/master) (master)
 - csv save uses relative paths (0.0.19)
 - urls that end in {expression} are filtered out.
